## General Clustering Analysis

### Figure 1: Cluster Distribution (`cluster_distribution_*.png`)

**Description:**
This bar chart displays the distribution of health data records across the four identified clusters (Cluster 0, 1, 2, and 3). Each bar represents the total number of patient records assigned to a specific cluster, providing an overview of cluster balance and size.

**Interpretation:**
- **Balanced Distribution**: If bars are relatively similar in height, it indicates that the clustering algorithm has successfully partitioned the data into roughly equal-sized groups, suggesting distinct patient segments.
- **Imbalanced Distribution**: Significant differences in bar heights may indicate:
  - One dominant patient pattern (largest cluster)
  - Rare but distinct patient groups (smaller clusters)
  - Potential need for different numbers of clusters

**Business Insights:**
- Helps identify the most common patient profile (largest cluster)
- Guides resource allocation based on cluster sizes
- Indicates whether patient segmentation is meaningful or if most patients fall into one category

**Key Metrics:**
- Total number of records per cluster
- Relative proportion of each cluster
- Cluster balance ratio (largest/smallest cluster size)

### Figure 2: Age vs Risk Score by Cluster (`age_vs_risk_by_cluster_*.png`)

**Description:**
This scatter plot visualizes the relationship between patient age (x-axis) and risk score (y-axis), with each point colored according to its assigned cluster. The color gradient helps identify which clusters represent different combinations of age and risk characteristics.

**Interpretation:**
- **Cluster Patterns**: 
  - Clusters that form distinct regions indicate successful separation based on age-risk combinations
  - Overlapping clusters suggest similar patient profiles
- **Age-Risk Relationships**:
  - Positive correlation: Older patients tend to have higher risk scores
  - Negative correlation: Younger patients with high risk (unusual cases)
  - No clear pattern: Risk is independent of age
- **Cluster Characteristics**:
  - Upper-right quadrant: Older, high-risk patients (likely requiring intensive care)
  - Lower-left quadrant: Younger, low-risk patients (preventive care candidates)
  - Upper-left quadrant: Younger, high-risk patients (urgent intervention needed)
  - Lower-right quadrant: Older, low-risk patients (well-managed chronic conditions)

**Business Insights:**
- Identifies high-priority patient groups (high risk regardless of age)
